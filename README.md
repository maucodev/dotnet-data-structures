# Data Structures Project

This repository contains the implementation of various data structures in C#, organized into multiple projects. The goal of this project is to reinforce the understanding and application of essential data structures by implementing them from scratch.

## Project Structure

The solution is organized into separate projects, each focused on a specific category of data structures. This modular approach allows for better organization and easier management of the codebase.

Additional projects will be added as more data structures are implemented.

## Prerequisites

To run and modify this project, you will need:

- **Visual Studio 2022** or later
- **.NET 8 SDK** or later

Ensure that you have the required tools and SDKs installed to build and run the projects within this solution.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maucodev/DataStructures.git
    ```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio:

    ```bash
    cd DataStructures
    start DataStructures.sln
    ```

3. Build the solution:

    - In Visual Studio, go to **Build** > **Build Solution** or press `Ctrl + Shift + B`.

4. Run the projects:

    - Right-click on the desired project in the **Solution Explorer** and select **Set as StartUp Project**.
    - Press `F5` to run the project.

## Learning Path

This project is inspired by the course **"The Ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms"** by Mosh Hamedani. The codebase is designed to complement the lessons from the course, with a focus on hands-on practice and deeper understanding.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find a bug, have an idea for a new feature, or want to improve the existing code, feel free to submit a pull request.
